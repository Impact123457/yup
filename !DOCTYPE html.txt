  <h3 id="podnaslov">
     1981-1983: Early history and Too Fast for Love
  </h3>
     <p>
      <span style="color:">Motley Crue</span> was formed on January 17, 1981, when bassist Nikki Sixx left the band London and began rehearsing with drummer Tommy Lee and         guitarist/vocalist Greg Leon.
      Lee had previously worked with Leon in a band called Suite 19 and the trio practiced together for some time; Leon eventually decided not to continue with them. 
      Sixx and Lee then began a search for new members and soon met guitarists Robin Moore and Bob Deal, better known as Mick Mars, after answering an advertisement that          he placed in The Recycler that read: "Loud, rude and aggressive guitar player available". 
      Mars auditioned for Sixx, Moore and Lee, and was subsequently hired while Moore was fired at the same session according to the band's biography<b><span      style="color:red"> The Dirt</b></span>.
    </p>

    1983-1991: International fame and addiction struggles
  </h3>
     <p>
        "Too Fast For Love", the title track from the band's debut album, was reportedly recorded over a span of three days while the band members were under the influence of alcohol.
        Their antics included, according to the website "Page Six" urinating in public or on the floors of their bedrooms, and throwing beds and furniture such as futons out of hotel windows in Hamburg, Germany. 
        Nikki Sixx had been arrested for the first time while selling "chocolate" mescaline at a Rolling Stones concert in 1973. 
        The band became rapidly successful in the United States after playing at the US Festival in May 29, 1983, and also with the aid of the new medium of MTV. 
        Their second album, Shout at the Devil, was released in September 26, 1983. The album represented the band's mainstream breakthrough and would eventually be certified 4x platinum.

       Plot 
       </h3>
        
        <p>
          Based on Motley Crue's 2001 best-selling autobiography, <b>THE DIRT</b> is an unflinching story about sex, drugs, rock 'n roll, fame, and the high price of excess. Director Jeff Tremaine shows us just how Nikki Sixx (Douglas Booth), Mick Mars (Iwan Rheon), Tommy Lee (Colson Baker), and Vince Neil (Daniel Webber) took Motley Crue from the Sunset Strip to the world stage, and what it meant to become the world's most notorious rock band.<div>
            The group struggles to make a living while hoping for a record deal when they are discovered one night while playing a gig at the Whisky A Go-Go in Hollywood. From that point, the boys make a record, go on tour and rise to the top of the charts in rock music. This newfound celebrity and wealth is seen as a ticket to excess as well as success and all the boys abuse heavy drugs and alcohol. They also have unlimited, indiscriminate sexual encounters with girls and become famous for their exploits before and after concerts as well as in hotel rooms and even in their own homes.<div>
             <p> </p> In spite of the meteoric rise to fame, each of the boys longs for stable home lives but their lifestyles prevent any sort of long-lasting relationships or stability. Each of them suffers personal tragedies including death and estrangement in core relationships but they persevere and maintain through it all because of their love of the music.<div>
